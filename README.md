Smartcontract using solidity 
it is a self-executing agreement program to implemented in the blockchain platform using a olidity programming language and it is a high-level language designed specifically for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, although it can also be used on other blockchain platforms. In Solidity, you can define smart contracts by writing code that specifies the contract's functionality, rules, and interactions with other contracts and users.
Error Handling in this Solidity programming language - Module1
In Solidity, we can define smart contracts by writing code  and its specifies the contract's functionality, rules, and interactions with other contracts and users. This Solidity smart contract demonstrates error handling techniques using the require, assert, and revert statements. Let's explore how error handling is implemented in the code!
Getting started 
1.Open the Remix IDE in your web browser. To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

2.Creating the smart contract: Start a new file in the code editor within Remix. Copy and paste the following code into the file:

''' // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity 0.8.17;

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
contract smartcontract {
    uint public totalValue;
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function deposit(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than zero");
        totalValue += amount;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the contract owner can withdraw");
        require(amount <= totalValue, "Insufficient balance");
        totalValue -= amount;
    }

    function divide(uint numerator, uint denominator) public pure returns (uint) {
        require(denominator > 0, "Denominator must be greater than zero");
        assert(numerator / denominator > 0);
        return numerator / denominator;
    }

    function triggerRevert() public pure {
        revert("This function always reverts");
    }
}
purpose 
It's important to note that require(), assert(), and revert() are used for different
The require() statement is used to check conditions before executing a function. If the condition evaluates to false, it will revert the transaction and provide an error message.

The assert() statement is used to check for internal errors and ensure that certain conditions are always true. If the condition evaluates to false, it indicates a bug in the contract, and the transaction will be reverted.

The revert() statement is used to explicitly revert the transaction with a custom error message. It can be used to intentionally revert a function or as part of error handling.
Compiling and deploying the Contract:
.Use the Remix compiler panel to compile your smart contract. .Select the appropriate compiler version pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
1.Switch to the "Deploy & run transactions" tab in Remix.

2.Deploy the compiled contract by clicking the "Deploy" button.
Interacting with the smart contract:
1.Utilize the Remix IDE to interact with the deployed contract create.

2.In the above smart contract, there are two functions: totalvalue() and owner(). Both functions take an input _value and set the value variable of the contract to that input value. However, they use different error handling mechanisms.

3.Input the adress and value and click on the corresponding function buttons to execute our contract.
